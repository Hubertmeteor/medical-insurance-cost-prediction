Step 1:Data processing

Data processing is a crucial step in any data analysis or machine learning project. It involves transforming raw data into a format that is suitable for analysis, modeling, and visualization.

Step 2:Data Visualization

Data visualization is an important aspect of data processing, as it allows to explore the data, identify patterns, and communicate insights effectively. Visualization techniques include plots, charts, graphs, and dashboards.

Step 3:Replace categorical Values

The replace method to replace categorical values with numerical values in the DataFrame df. This can be useful when working with machine learning algorithms that require numerical input.

step 4:LinearRegression model
